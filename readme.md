Create a "sounds" folder in next to lua and toc files.

Put your mp3's in there.

In game.

- You can open player with drum on minimap
- You can see music through dropdown once added.
- Click plus
- Modal opens
- First box - Type name of mp3 you put into sounds folder. (Without mp3 extension at the end)

-Give it a name that will be seen in the dropdown

Once added you can do a /reload and it should be in the dropdown

FIRST TIME USING WITH NO MUSIC FILE?

-I provided basshunter - now your gone ---> hello.mp3

Now add a song.
Top box type: hello
since the name of the mp3 is hello.mp3
next the name of the song
BassHunter- Now your gone
Add song

It will now be in the dropdown congrats.

Ty hope this works for people
